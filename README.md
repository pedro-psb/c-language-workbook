# C language workbook

Here I'll add small exercises to practice the C language.

Currently, I'm using the following exercise resources:
* "The C Programming Language Book"
* PDS1 courses (UFMG, 2023/2).

## Aditional Resources

### Minimal TDD template

Simple template file with minimal test setup.

It leverages "assert.h", some custom macros and boilerplate stuctures.
And features a envvar reader to switch between the program flow and the test suite
  (within the same binary).
